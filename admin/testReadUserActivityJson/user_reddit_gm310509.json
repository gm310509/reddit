But it is a bit tedious to have to switch to the browser, refresh the figures and get back to whatever you were doing.\n\nThis inspired my project, which allows me to easily (on an Arduino) see:\n\n* the current subscriber count which increases fairly regularly,\n* the number of active users which fluctuates quite a bit,\n* number of new subscribers over a few intervals,\n* the next target and an estimate for when that target will be reached.\n\nI've posted all of the code, description and instructions on my website at [http://www.gm310509.com/aaa/subredditMonitor/index.html](http://www.gm310509.com/aaa/subredditMonitor/index.html).\n\nOn the [website](http://www.gm310509.com/aaa/subredditMonitor/index.html) you will find:\n\n* An overview of the project,\n* A parts list,\n* Wiring diagrams,\n* A download for the code.\n* Instructions showing how to set it up, test it and run it.\n\nSo you can make it yourself and also monitor the progress to 500K subscribers, then 600K and so on.

Including:\n   * Encapsulation - Each major part of the program is compartmentalised into its own file - rather than one gigantic hard to read program.\n   * Abstraction - Especially noticeable in relation to the displays, there are a set of functions that do various things - such as display the current data. These functions are simply called in the main program and it is assumed that they will \"do the right thing\".Later, the different display types (encapsulated) modules \"implement\" these functions. When asked to do so, they display the data in a form that suits the specific type of display they are driving.This makes it super easy to add new display types.This is also revealed in the main program in that it \"just works\" no matter which display is connected. In other words, we can change or add display types and do not need to worry about making changes in the main program.\n   * Inheritance - the display modules inherit from (subclass) the base Metrics class.

For example `leftNormalMouth1` etc,\n\nI would be inclined to put all of those things into a separate file (rather than inline in the function declarations). This is more of a cosmetic thing as it allows you to separate the data from the code and thus can make the code a bit easier to work with.\n\nAfter doing this, and I didn't read through your program in enough detail to verify that this is valid, you could potentially create a function that displays a line of the image from the array where a line and the image data is passed as a parameter.\n\nWhat I mean by that is sort of along the lines of the `printSprite` method, but extended to code such as `edgyEyesBlink` which is basically data held inline within the code.\n\nAnother potential code optimisation is your checking of the buttons. For example, if you put your button pins into an array, you could use a for look to read them:\n\n```\n\nint buttonPins [] = {\n  PULS1, PULS2, PULS3, PULS4,\n  PULS5, PULS6, PULS7, PULS8\n};\n\nconst int numButtons = sizeof(buttonPins) / sizeof(buttonPins[0]);\n```\n\nThen in loopBlink you could use something like this:\n\n```\nvoid loopBlink(byte x){\n  while(tempo&lt;=7000){//'delay' for being receptive and don't do the blick animation every time but only every 7 seconds \n    delay(1);\n//    if(digitalRead(PULS1)) face=1;//the value of face will be passed to the switch \n//    if(digitalRead(PULS8)) face=8;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numButtons; i++) {\n      if (digitalRead(buttonPins[i]) {   // See note 1 below.\n        face = x + 1;     // +1 because you count from 1 whereas C arrays count from 0\n         break;           // See note 2 &amp; 3 below.\n      }\n    if(face!=x) {\n      mx.clear();//if face change it clears all the matrixes and exit from the while\n      tempo=7000;\n    }\n    tempo++;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotes:  \n1. It is usually a good idea to make a concrete comparison - in this case `== HIGH`.\n2. the `break` statement ends the loop when it detects a button is pressed. It isn't necessary to keep checking once you have found a button press.\n3. the use of `break` means my version of the code will produce a different result to your version if multiple buttons are pressed at the same time. My version will stop checking when it finds the first pressed button - yours will keep checking and return the last button found to be pressed. To make mine work the same as yours, just remove the `break` statement.\n\nIf you are not familiar with `struct` you might want to have a look at those. A struct can be used to create a complex data type - for example, you *might* be able to use a struct to record the coordinates and a pointer to an image in the `edgyEyesBlink` function (note I said might - not can).\n\nOnce you learn about structs, the next level is Object Oriented classes - which is basically a `struct` but with code embedded within it. So you could, for example, create a class containing a type of image that can support different animations. A more advanced use would be to have a base class (e.g. animation) that defines some basic abstract standard methods, then subclass that into eyes, mouth etc specific types that are forced to \"implement those abstract methods\". What that could mean for your program is that the main program will simply become very short as all it needs to do is respond to the button clicks, then activate the various object types (e.g. eyes, mouth etc) via the generic (abstract) methods defined within the base abstract class.\n\nWhile that might sounds a little bit convoluted and very complex (and it can be if it is new to you), but you can see a relatively simple example in a project I have posted online where I do exactly this to support display of data on different types of display devices - you can have a look at this on my web site where I documented my [subreddit monitor](http://gm310509.com/aaa/subredditMonitor/index.html). The first page shows the three types of display I support. If you check the mainline, you can see that there is virtually nothing related to the specific display type (other than a declaration of the display I'm compiling for),  The rest of the code just \"magically\" works out the correct things to be done to actually display the supplied data (which is unique to each type of display). In your case, the unique bit might be the types of images you display (e.g. eyes, mouth).\n\nThere may well be other optimisations, but these are a couple that stood out.\n\nNice project BTW - very cute.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "1st 400K"}, {"a": ":400K:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/apsbyvbwmfe91_t5_2qknj/400K"}, {"e": "text", "t": " now 500K"}, {"a": ":Arduino_500k:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/o5qzzwwkvk5a1_t5_2qknj/Arduino_500k"}, {"e": "text", "t": " - next?

Adopt a colour coding scheme for your wiring to make it easier to see shorts. Start with Black for GND, Red for the biggest +V/V1/VCC (e.g. the 5V supply lines), Orange if you have a second (smaller) V2/VDD (e.g. 3V3) and so on.  \n2. Check your wiring.  \n3. After 2, check your wiring (i.e. do it again).  \n4. Compare your wiring to your circuit design diagram (if. you didn't do one, do it now, then compare it).  \n5. If you can, get someone else to check your wiring.  \n6. Check all power and GND connections - looking for reverse polarities.  \n\n7.

Because this will force you to learn some technical things that will/may help you understand why things work (or don&amp;#39;t work) when you are learning something more tolerant to errors that you might otherwise make (especially if you want to use it within a browser environment).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May I ask why did you pick Javascript?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_15wgdg4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskProgramming/comments/15wgdg4/hey_guys_im_currently_a_highschool_student_do_you/jx37bbh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/15wgdg4/hey_guys_im_currently_a_highschool_student_do_you/", "name": "t1_jx37bbh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskProgramming", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1692590100.0, "created_utc": 1692590100.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/15wgdg4/hey_guys_im_currently_a_highschool_student_do_you/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknj", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Push button not registering properly", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "arduino", "link_author": "i_remember_you_x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jx36i85", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "gm310509", "num_comments": 13, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jwymrfl", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6d167rfx", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The main thing I was thinking of related to the code that you removed - so this is largely from my memory of my brief observation of it.\n\nWithin the \"true block\" of this if statement:\n\n```\n// Pedestrian crossing sequence when pedestrian button is pressed\n  if (pedestrianState1 == LOW || pedestrianState2 == LOW){\n    // removed sequence for this post\n  }\n```\n\nMy recollection was that you:  \n1. set the first LED pattern, then delayed for a period of time,\n2. set the second LED pattern, delayed again,\n3. set the third pattern, delayed  \nand so on.\n\nThe problem with this is a simple rule which is *delay bad*, don't use delay - except in very limited circumstances.\n\nYou might want to have a look at a video I created about [The Importance of Blink No Delay](https://youtu.be/MRwaiFTkw_k). It covers the problem (use of delay), the solution (don't use delay) and how that solution works. It is also an introduction to state machines which is an important concept in embedded programming.\n\nSo what is the problem with your program?  I'm not sure if you intend your program to be simulating an intersection or just a simple crossing across a straight piece of road. Either way, the following will matter - just a little less so if your model is the latter (crossing a straight road).\n\nThinking firstly about an intersection, it is possible that someone presses the button in one direction (e.g. the north/south direction) and activates the sequence. While it is in progress, someone might push the button in the intersecting direction (i.e. the east west direction).\n\nNow the problem is that - as written - if the second person comes along, your program will totally ignore that person's button press until the first sequence completes.\n\nThis is where the concepts behind blink no delay comes into play.\n\nNote how I wrote your sequence about above - I wrote it as a numbered list.\n\nTo overcome the problem I mentioned, you need to program the number list - as opposed to a linear sequence.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that when the button is pressed, you activate step 1. But, rather than delaying, you record the time (`millis()`) that you started step 1. You might also want to set the duration that step number 1 lasts. There is other stuff you need to do, but for now, we will just assume the `loop` returns with nothing else happening.\n\nNow every time you enter loop, you check if it is time to do step 2 or not. If it isn't, then just do the other stuff (see below) and return. If it is time, then do the same as before: Set the step 2 pattern, set the duration and just drop through to the rest of the stuff.\n\nHopefully you can see how this simply extends to step 4, 5 and so on.\n\nNow for the other stuff.... Since you are not \"throwing away time\" and \"ignoring button presses\" by calling `delay`, you can check to see if another button has been pressed - and if it has, simply remember that fact. When the first sequence finishes, you can just launch into the next sequence.\n\nAs a result, your program will be more realistic.\n\nNow if this is for a simple crossing across a road, then this still applies - albeit slightly less so - where I live, if a pedestrian has a green light then button presses in that direction as basically ignored (like your system), but we also have a \"warning\" symbol that is a bit like a yellow light indicating that the walk time is ending. If the pedestrian presses the button during this time, then the button press is registered and (after the cars get a bit of a turn), the pedestrian sequence will reactivate.\n\nI don't know if you know how to remember stuff across calls to a function like `loop` or not, but you can either make variables global (not necessary for this example - and thus not best practice), or you can define them as static within loop (or whatever function you implement this in). Another video I've created [Introduction to debugging](https://youtu.be/etRAeExcNcs) video discusses this in the section where I debug \"variable forgetfulness\".\n\nI hope that makes sense. If not, hopefully the videos I've created will help.

If not, how do you know given that there is no feedback for button presses?\n\nYou might want to have a look at our [debugging guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/guides/debugging_introduction/#wiki_an_introduction_to_debugging) to which I just added a video version of the same (link in the guide).

I suggest have a look at the [Input Pullup Serial](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/digital/InputPullupSerial) example program (aka DigitalInputPullup in the IDE). I will refer to this in the rest of my comment.\n\nNote how the button is placed in the breadboard. It is placed across the breadboard's \"grand canyon\". Also note that there is no resistor. \n\nThe reason the button is placed the way it is is to eliminate the risk of it being wrongly placed - which can happen if you insert it into the main part of the breadboard as in your circuit diagram.\n\nWhy? Because if you look closely at most buttons like the one you have shown, they are rectangular, not square. By placing it across the \"canyon\" it forces you to correctly orient it - it will only fit in one orientation (actually two orientations, but both are the same). By placing it in the body of the connection area (like your diagram), you can misorient it and thus accidentally configure it as a \"wire\" (i.e. always closed) rather than a button. To be clear, by placing the button across the canyon, you cannot make the mistake of orienting it 90 degrees - which would make it a wire as placed in your diagram.\n\nWire up your buttons like it is shown in the example, you can still use the \"blue bus connector\" along the bottom of the breadboard as a common ground like you have done in your circuit. \n\nSo, definitely move your button to \"span the canyon\".\n\nNext upload the example Input Pullup Serial program - if you want to change the input pin to 7, then that is also fine (as long as that is where the button is connected). If you change, it make sure you change it throughout the program - this example, sadly and stupidly, doesn't use a named constant for the button pin.\n\nFinally, observe the builtin LED. With a \"Normally Open\" (NO) button, the LED should be off. When you press it, the LED should turn on.\n\nIf you have a \"Normally Closed\" (NC) button, then the LED will be on and when you press the button, the LED will go off. If this is the case, then you can \"fix\" your program, by changing the if statement to test for HIGH (rather than LOW).\n\nMost buttons are Normally Open, so this probably isn't the problem, but it is a possibility.\n\nTLDR: Move your buttons to bridge the breadboard canyon test for your buttons being NC and adjust accordingly - read the above for details about this and debugging.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "1st 400K"}, {"a": ":400K:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/apsbyvbwmfe91_t5_2qknj/400K"}, {"e": "text", "t": " now 500K"}, {"a": ":Arduino_500k:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/o5qzzwwkvk5a1_t5_2qknj/Arduino_500k"}, {"e": "text", "t": " - next?

And to be safe (although &lt;em&gt;in this particular example&lt;/em&gt; probably not necessary) change all of the integer constants in the calculations to decimal values:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;```\nfloat speedOnePerc = 0;\nfloat usageSpeedPerc = 0;\nfloat stepperSpeed = 0;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;speedOnePerc = (100. / biggestDistance);\nusageSpeedPerc = speedOnePerc * stepper1.distanceToGo();\nstepperSpeed = (maxSpeed / 100.) * usageSpeedPerc;\n```&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_15v9jqv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/arduino/comments/15v9jqv/code_not_calculating_correctly/jwtz0af/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/15v9jqv/code_not_calculating_correctly/", "name": "t1_jwtz0af", "author_flair_template_id": "3c7c2258-7a90-11ed-a4a7-22b19dced614", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/arduino", "author_flair_text": "1st 400K:400K: now 500K:Arduino_500k: - next?

Obviously it also manipulates the relevant CPU registers to enable the interrupt, but the key and relevant bit is that it simply store the function pointer in an array.\n\nWhen the interrupt fires, the rest of the Arduino HAL simply calls the supplied function stored in the array. This is achieved via the `IMPLEMENT_ISR` macro (code below)...\n\nThere is (probably), no reason why that couldn't step through a list of functions - the challenge, as you pointed out, is how long is a list?\n\nHere is the IMPLEMENT_ISR macro:\n\n```\n#define IMPLEMENT_ISR(vect, interrupt) \\\n  ISR(vect) { \\\n    intFunc[interrupt](); \\\n  }\n\n```\n\nAnd an example definition for an Uno:\n```\n#define EXTERNAL_INT_0 0\n#define EXTERNAL_INT_1 1\n#define EXTERNAL_INT_2 2\n\n\nIMPLEMENT_ISR(INT0_vect, EXTERNAL_INT_0)\nIMPLEMENT_ISR(INT1_vect, EXTERNAL_INT_1)\n```\n\nNB: I've \"borrowed\" code from different source files in the above snippet.\n\nOne challenge - which is 100% achievable - is that the ISR vectors are stored in flash. So, either pointers to \"your ISR\" would need to be established at compile time, in favour of the Arduino HAL pointers, or you would have to alter the flash dynamically with appropriate SPM instructions.\n\nFor me, when I tap into interrupts (usually timer interrupts), I try to use a vector that isn't being used (e.g. timer2 - I never use tone), and if I need to do two things - given that it is just my code running on the MCU and I don't have to share or play nicely with other loaded modules such as device drivers - I just do the two or more things I need to do in the ISR. \n\nUsually I place them in a single function, but in some instances, I just call a function or functions from the ISR - especially when I want to be able to demonstrate the purpose of why the ISR approach is needed. For example, in my [countdown clock](https://www.instructables.com/Event-Countdown-Clock-Covid-Clock-V20/) the ClockDisplay.c can switch between using interrupts and not to illustrate why interrupts are needed.

For example a GPS, a MEMS sensor (a 9 axis sensor can give you compass directions, pitch, yaw, roll and acceleration in 3 dimensions).\n\nAs for can an 8 bit Arduino do this, I'm going to go with a definite yes.

However, this does matter in relation to a full blown Raspberry Pi, which is a relatively huge consumer of power compared to an 8 bit Arduino. Obviously it isn't completely black and white / one extreme or the other, there is a range of platforms that create a full spectrum of power consumption and features available for you.\n\nThis is why getting a starter kit is helpful, because you will begin to gather knowledge that will help you to understand how to select the actual platform that you will use in your project.\n\nI mentioned use of an SD Card in my project just now - that was great, but I found it was prone to errors (causing SD Card corruption) due to vibration.
